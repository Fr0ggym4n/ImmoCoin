# üè¢ ImmoCoin Project

## Introduction

Your team has been contacted to create ImmoCoin, the future leader in apartment listings. The concept is simple: you will create a marketplace where people can post real estate ads.

Pedagogically, our interest in making you look into this project is multiple:

- Already, you will learn to work in a team before the final projects. A good old crash test to test your ability to work together
- Then we planned to make you work on a classic of web applications: the marketplace, and show you that it is possible to purify a marketplace as much as possible to have a functional version in a few days.
- Finally, by purifying the functionalities as much as possible, we want you to work on what you need to find a job: code less, but well. Do not dwell on yet another feature (which you will know how to code, we are sure of it), but take time to do tests, make validations and everything that includes clean code.

## Specs In french

The project specs are [here](https://trello.com/b/U0GNiiYX/projet-en-%C3%A9quipe-marketplace). Copy this Trello board and the glory is yours.

## Work as a Team
This project is above all a team effort. You could see during the previous projects that you start to feel the code well. In order to perfect your training as a young padawan, all that is needed is the "teamwork" skill, which will be essential in your career, whether you work in a company or as a freelancer.

For this, we are going to ask you to use two project management techniques that you know.

The first is a Trello, with the architecture you want. We recommend that you use the one you know well. Did you know ? GitHub has a very similar project management tool to Trello. It's called [Project Boards](https://docs.github.com/en/issues/organizing-your-work-with-project-boards/managing-project-boards/about-project-boards).

The second is a classic GitHub flow, with branches and pipeline. For this project we are going to force you to merge only with the GitHub Pull Request tool. Code reviews are mandatory. Setting up and getting started in this configuration will not be easy at first, but taking the step is very simple, and these skills will be essential for you in your future life.

# Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `yarn start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.\
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### `yarn test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `yarn build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `yarn eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can‚Äôt go back!**

If you aren‚Äôt satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you‚Äôre on your own.

You don‚Äôt have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn‚Äôt feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn‚Äôt be useful if you couldn‚Äôt customize it when you are ready for it.
